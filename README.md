# PayRoll-Management-System
The Payroll Management System in Python automates employee salary calculations. It manages payroll by storing employee data, computing salaries with deductions and taxes, and generating payslips. The system ensures accuracy, reduces manual effort, and provides an intuitive interface for efficient payroll processing and record-keeping.

# Overview

The **Payroll Management System** is a Python-based application designed to manage employee payroll efficiently. The system leverages the `Tkinter` library for its graphical user interface (GUI) and uses SQL (SQLite) for data management. This application facilitates tasks such as adding employees, calculating salaries, generating pay slips, and maintaining payroll records.

# Features

- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and delete employee records.
- **Salary Calculation**: Automatic computation of salaries based on predefined criteria.
- **Pay Slip Generation**: Create and print pay slips for employees.
- **Data Storage**: Persist data in an SQLite database.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate GUI built with `Tkinter`.
- **Reports**: Generate reports on employee payroll data.

# Requirements

To run this project, you need the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- SQLite (bundled with Python as part of the `sqlite3` module)
